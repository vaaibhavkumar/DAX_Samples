# Samples
The sample files have Information and beginner to medium level code of the things that I am practicing 
from different sources like MSlibrary, MOOC courses on CourseEra and Udemy etc.
As of now I have attached 
1. Some sample R files along with comments 
2. One excel in which many DAX functions have been written. If we look at the excel it appears like a bunch of Normal PIVOT tables throw together. That is true, but one difference is each and every Measure displayed in the excel has been manually coded/ written in DAX.
